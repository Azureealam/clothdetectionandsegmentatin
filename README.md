# clothdetectionandsegmentatin
Developed a system that can detect clothes classify them like paint,shirts etc and segment clothes if logo is present it will preserve the logo area and original logo at the end you can also choose your color of shirt or clothes while preserving logo on it
The code can be broken down into the following main steps:

Initialization and Setup:

Imports necessary libraries including OpenCV, NumPy, PyTorch, Albumentations, and others.
Initializes Roboflow API, loads a model for logo detection, and loads a pre-trained clothing segmentation model.
Logo Detection:

Uses the Roboflow model to predict logo locations in the image.
Creates a binary mask for logo detection using the predicted logo points.
Preprocessing for Clothing Segmentation:

Applies padding to the image to ensure it's divisible by 32 (a requirement for some neural networks).
Applies normalization using Albumentations to preprocess the image for the clothing segmentation model.
Converts the preprocessed image into a PyTorch tensor.
Clothing Segmentation:

Performs clothing segmentation using the pre-trained model.
Resizes the segmentation mask to match the dimensions of the logo detection mask.
Object Detection using YOLOv3:

Uses YOLOv3 to perform object detection on the original image.
Filters out detected objects with confidence below a certain threshold.
Draws bounding boxes and labels around the detected objects on the image.
Applying Clothing Segmentation to Non-Logo Areas:

Defines a desired color for the shirt (in BGR format) using user input.
Creates a shirt-segmented image where the clothing segmentation mask is applied to the desired shirt color.
Combining Results:

Combines the shirt-segmented image with the original image, excluding logo areas using the non-logo indices calculated earlier.
Displaying Images:

Displays a series of images using matplotlib to visualize different stages of the processing, including the original image, preserved logo mask, shirt-segmented image, and the final result.
Please note that this code assumes that you have the required model weights, configurations, 
and image paths available. 
If you plan to use this code, make sure to adjust the paths and adapt it to your specific use case and data availability.
NOTE:calmy read the code and try to understand it with deep breath
